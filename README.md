## Backend for Frontend https://github.com/CarlosAlberto133/front_for_replicate

### Features

``
Receives at least 5 images uploaded by the user. The images are combined into a .zip file, which is then uploaded to AWS S3 to generate a download link.

Once the download link for the .zip file is obtained, it is sent to Replicate so that the selected model can perform a LoRA fine-tuning with the images. All information from the JSON generated by Replicate is passed from the backend to the frontend, allowing the user to view the entire process.

After the fine-tuning is complete, the backend receives a .tar file containing the weights of the user’s trained model. This file is unpacked to locate the .safetensors file. Once found, this file is also uploaded to AWS S3, where a download link for the user’s fine-tuned model is generated.

When the user clicks to test the model on the frontend, the backend retrieves the URL for the .safetensors file from AWS and passes it to a model on Replicate. This allows an image to be generated based on the user’s fine-tuned model, using both the user’s prompt and trigger word.

After Replicate generates the user’s image, it is processed by the backend and then sent to the user on the frontend.
